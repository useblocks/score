Project organization
====================

Steering committees
-------------------
Steering of the project is done by two committees: *project lead circle* and *technical lead circle*.

* **Project lead circle**

  Members of *Project lead circle* are the project leads of the *SCORE* project. The election of project leads is done as described in the `Project Roles chapter <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#roles-pl>`_ of *Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook*. In case of absence, a project lead can nominate a deputy.

  The main tasks of the *Project lead circle* are:

  * Definition, discussion of and decisions about strategical topics (e.g. which associations to approach, confirmation of roadmap, representation in public).
  * Decision on which new software modules should be added or removed from the project. The decision is done based on proposal from the *Technical lead circle*. In case of changes to the existing modules and no concordant decision in the *Technical Lead Circle*, the *Project Lead Circle* has to decide about the change.
  * Election of new Project Leads.
  * Election of Technical Leads.
  * Last instance of escalation path.

  *Project lead circle* proposes and elects a *Project lead circle Assistant* and his deputy with bare majority, who is responsible for scheduling and announcing meetings, preparing and announcing agenda, writing meeting minutes and protocols. *Project lead circle* can reelect *Project lead circle Assistant* at any time. The *Project lead circle Assistant* and his deputy can resign anytime on their own will.

* **Technical lead circle**

  Each *Project Lead* is allowed to nominate one *Technical Lead*. The *Technical Leads* form the "Technical Lead Circle". In case of absence, a technical lead can nominate a deputy. *Technical Leads* have the following responsibilities:

  * Review and approval of contributions, e.g. *Feature Requests*, which add or modify SCORE platform features.
  * Project management of the platform development, e.g., creation of the roadmap.
  * High-level project control and coordination between multiple software modules.
  * Escalation instance for software module project leads and committers.

  *Technical lead circle* proposes and elects a *Technical lead circle Assistant* and his deputy with bare majority during *Technical Lead Circle meeting*, who is responsible for scheduling and announcing meetings, preparing and announcing agenda, writing meeting minutes and protocols. *Technical lead circle* can reelect *Technical lead circle Assistant* at any time. The *Technical lead circle Assistant* and his deputy can resign anytime on their own will.

Technical committees
--------------------
* **Communities**

  *Communities* allow committers and contributors to exchange their
  opinions, take architectural decisions and implement the topics of some special
  technical domain, e.g. testing tooling. One of the *Communities*' important activities
  is to do a breakdown of platform sagas to the concrete tasks (see `Planning`_) .
  Currently following *Communities* are defined in the *SCORE* project:

  * *Operational*: *community* for all kind of infra topics:
    compiler, IDE, build toolchain and etc. See `GitHub Discussions/Operational Community  <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/operational-community>`_ for more.
  * *Testing*: *community* to clarify questions and define testing strategy
    for the 'SCORE' project. See `GitHub Discussions/Testing Community <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/testing-community>`_ for more.
  * *Software Architecture*: *community* for clarification of software architecture topics,
    e.g. discussion of new features or coding guidelines. See `GitHub Discussions/Architecture Community <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/architecture-community>`_ for more.
  * *Software Development Process*: *community* for definition and maintaining
    of safety, security and quality software development process. See `GitHub Discussions/SW Dev Process Community <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/sw-dev-process-community>`_ for more.

  The planning of the activities is done by every *Community* independent of other
  teams. Each *Community* has a *Community Lead*, who is nominated by the *Technical lead circle*. The prioritization of some topics can be requested by the *Technical lead circle*
  in order to achieve milestones on time. All important architectural decisions
  should be reported to the project as *Feature Request* to get the final approvement from the *Technical lead circle*.

* **Cross functional teams**

  *Cross functional teams* are responsible for some piece
  of work from the beginning (e.g. definition of the architecture) till the end
  (e.g. integration tests) and are usually assigned to the *SCORE* main integration project or to one particular software module. *Cross-functional teams* work independently from each other on *GitHub Issues* in the assigned software module. *Cross-functional teams* consist of the contributors, who can specify requirements, define architecture, develop source code and implement tests afterwards. *Project Leads* and *Committers* are also *Contributors* and effectively work on processing of *GitHub Issues*.

  *Cross-functional team* usually consists of the following roles: Project Lead, Safety Manager, Quality Manager, Security Manager, Committers and Contributors. Every *cross-functional* team has at least one committer who can approve and merge the Pull Requests of the Contributors.

  In case *Cross-functional team* needs to request a new repository, this can be done be extending the `otterdog configuration file <https://github.com/eclipse-score/.eclipsefdn/blob/main/otterdog/eclipse-score.jsonnet>`_ and creating a new PR, that should be approved by the *Eclipse Project Security Team*.

  The *GitHub Discussions* for cross-functional teams can be found in the `Cross-functional teams section <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions>`_ of the main *SCORE* project.

Meeting Structure
-----------------

* **Project Lead Circle meeting**

  Regular participants of *Project Lead Circle meeting* are the *Project Leads* and *Technical Leads* of the main *SCORE* project. The main purpose of the meeting is the exchange between *Project Leads* and the reporting of the *Technical Lead Circle* to the *Project Lead Circle* and vice versa.

  The *Project Lead Circle meetings* are announced via *score-dev@eclipse.org* mailing list and are open for everyone who is registered to this mailing list. All meetings are documented as *GitHub Discussions* in `Project Lead Circle section <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/project-lead-circle>`_ and can be read by everyone. Topics for the *Project lead circle meetings* can be proposed only by regular participants and will be prioritized by the *Project lead circle Assistant*. Proposals for agenda topics can be added as comment to the respective *GitHub Discussion* or sent to the *Project lead circle Assistant*.

  Open points from the meetings will be handled by *GitHub Issues* in the *SCORE* main repository and can be filtered via *project_lead_circle* label.

  The *Project Lead Circle meeting* takes place usually once a week.


* **Technical Lead Circle meeting**

  Regular participants of the *Technical Lead Circle meeting* are the *Technical Leads* of the main *SCORE* project. The main purpose of the meeting is the exchange between technical leads for fulfilling their responsibilities.

  The *Technical Lead Circle meetings* are announced via *score-dev@eclipse.org* mailing list and are open for everyone who is registered to this mailing list. All meetings are documented as *GitHub Discussions* in `Technical Lead Circle section <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/technical-lead-circle>`_ and can be read by everyone. Topics for the *Technical lead circle meetings* can be proposed only by regular participants and will be prioritized by the *Technical lead circle Assistant*. Proposals for agenda topics can be added as comment to the respective *GitHub Discussion* or sent to the *Technical lead circle Assistant*.

  Open points from the meetings will be handled by *GitHub Issues* in the *SCORE* main repository and can be filtered via label *technical_lead_circle*.

  The *Technical Lead Circle meeting* takes place usually once a week.

* **Committer Circle Meeting**

  Regular participants of the *Committer Circle meeting* are the *Committers* of the main *SCORE* project and of all software modules/child projects. The *Committer Circle Meeting* is lead by the *Technical Leads*. The main purpose of the meeting are in-depth technical discussions and evaluation of contributions, e.g. *Feature Requests*, that could not be approved in the *Technical Lead Circle meeting* and demand more technical discussions.

  The *Committer Circle meetings* are announced via *score-dev@eclipse.org* mailing list and are open for everyone who is registered to this mailing list. All meetings are documented as *GitHub Discussions* in `Committer Circle section <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/categories/committer-circle>`_ and can be read by everyone. Topics for the *Committer circle meetings* can be proposed only by regular participants and will be prioritized by the *Technical lead circle*. Proposals for agenda topics can be added as comment to the respective *GitHub Discussion* or sent to the *Technical lead circle Assistant*.

  The *Committer Circle meeting* takes place on demand. The decision for the scheduling of the *Committer Circle Meeting* is taken by the *Technical Lead Circle*.

Platform structure
==================
Platform consists of multiple repositories. The main repository, *SCORE*,
is the integration repository, where everything comes together. It contains:

* :ref:`stakeholder requirements <Stakeholder_Requirements>`
* documentation of all :ref:`platform features <features>` and features flags,
  feature requirements and architecture
* build system including *SCORE* specific *macros* and *rules*
* integration rules for software modules.

The main repository references multiple other repositories, mostly repositories, where
software modules or toolchains are defined. This results in the following :ref:`Folder Structure of Platform Repository <Platform_Folder_Structure>`. Every software module has its own repository, that contains multiple components, their requirements, architecture, implementation and tests.
A software module and its repository can be part of the main SCORE *Eclipse Project* and corresponding *GitHub organization* or can be moved to a standalone *Eclipse child project*, if necessary.

     :alt: Infrastructure overview
     :align: center

Platform organization
=======================
Also in case the software module repositories are not placed
in standalone *Eclipse child projects*, we still consider all software modules
to be standalone *Eclipse child projects*, having their own *Committers* and *Project Leads*
as defined by the *Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook*. Software module committers
and software module project leads are responsible for managing the software module as if it were
a normal *Eclipse child project*. The election of the project leads and committers for software module projects should be done using the main integration *SCORE* project mailing list, *score-dev@eclipse.org*. This means, that the decision who will be the project lead and committer of the new software module will be taken by the project leads and committers of the main *SCORE* project respectively. The elected project leads or committers of the software modules are not automatically project leads and committers of the main integration *SCORE* project. Typically, before becoming a project lead or a committer of the main integration *SCORE* project, you need to build up a good reputation by contributing to the main integration *SCORE* project and being project lead or committer for one of the software modules.

Before introducing a new *Eclipse child project* for a software module, it should first reside as a repository in the main *SCORE* project. If the software module later would be moved to a real standalone *Eclipse child project*, e.g., as there is a wish to use this software module independent of the *SCORE* project, then the elected project leads and committers of the software module will be simply taken over as project leads and committers of the new *Eclipse child project* and their tasks will stay the same. Further in this document differentiation between a software module and  *Eclipse child project* will be done only if necessary. For the software module that resides in the separate repository of the main *SCORE* project, the configuration and the control
of who is committer and project lead is done using
`CODEOWNER files <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners>`_
located in the subfolder of the corresponding repository of the software module.

Main task of project leads is planning and prioritizing of activities, and together with the committers maintaining of the backlog and ensuring, that the software development is done according to process described in the main SCORE project. The planning should be done as described in the `Planning`_ chapter. A more detailed description of PLs' and Committers' activities is given in *Eclipse Foundation Project Handbook*.

The main project *SCORE* has certainly also project leaders and committers, but
their roles are slightly different compared to the software module committers and
project leads. The role of the *SCORE* project as the central project is, as already
described, to ensure proper integration of multiple software modules, provide common
integration guidelines and mechanisms, e.g. build toolchain. Additionally *SCORE* project
takes care of all overarching topics, as e.g. roadmap and milestone planning or
definition of cross-functional topics. Therefore there exist number of additional
meetings, where such topics are discussed and decided, see `Steering committees`_ for further details.

Planning
========

Planning infrastructure
------------------------
`GitHub issues <https://github.com/features/issues>`_ are used to plan and to track
work. To be able to find issues faster and to filter for them more efficiently,
we use labels.

Labels
^^^^^^
To facilitate the organization and tracking of tickets related to the same feature
or topic, labels are utilized for issues and pull requests. Labels are a powerful
feature that allows you to search and filter tickets based on specific labels, and
you can save these filters in a *GitHub Project* view. However, it is important
to exercise caution when creating labels to avoid confusion and ensure easy tracking.

It's worth noting that labels are associated with a repository, not a *GitHub Project*.
To create new labels in the repository requires special rights and only
*project leads* and *committers* should have this capability.

For the main *SCORE* repository, there exist already some predefined labels:

* *feature_request* label is used to identify *PRs* and *GitHub Issues* that are part
  of a *Feature request process*
* *project_lead_circle*  label is used to identify *PRs* and *GitHub Issues* that are relevant
  for *Project lead circle*
* *tech_lead_circle*  label is used to identify *PRs* and *GitHub Issues* that are relevant
  for *Technical lead circle*
* *infrastructure*  label is used to identify *PRs* and *GitHub Issues* that are relevant
  for *Tooling/Infrastructure Community*
* *testing*  label is used to identify *PRs* and *GitHub Issues* that are relevant for
  *Testing Community*
* *software_architecture*  label is used to identify *PRs* and *GitHub Issues* that are relevant
  for *Software Architecture community*
* *software_development_process*  label is used to identify *PRs* and *GitHub Issues* that are
  relevant for *Software Development Process Community*

  .. image:: _assets/contribution_request_label.png
     :width: 800
     :alt: Infrastructure overview
     :align: center

Additionally, in the main *SCORE* repository there should exist a label for every
software module.

Every software module project, located in another repository, is free to define
additionally its own labels. It is recommended to create labels at least
for specific areas that may encompass multiple features.

Types of tasks and structure
------------------------------
For better structuring of the tickets following *GitHub Issue* types are introduced
in the main *SCORE* repository. It is recommended for all *child projects* to
introduce the same types.

.. image:: _assets/issue_types.png
    :width: 600
    :alt: Issue types overview
    :align: center

* *Saga* *GitHub Issue* of type *Saga* is the highest level hierarchy and can not
  be a sub-issue of another ticket. If you want to group *Sagas* together, you will
  need to use labels. *Saga* can have multiple *Epics* as sub-issues. In really
  exceptional cases, also a *Story* can be a direct sub-issue of a *Saga* as well.
* *Epic* *GitHub Issue* of type *Epic* groups multiple *Stories* together and is sub-issue
  of exactly one *Saga*. *Epics* can be also standalone *GitHub Issues* without being
  a child of any *Saga*. *Saga* should be the only way for grouping *Epics* together.
  Grouping standalone *Epics* with labels is not something, what we encourage you to do.
* *Story* *GitHub Issue* of type *Story* is the lowest planning granularity and represents
  concrete task, that should be done, e.g. by a developer. Normally *Stories* are
  grouped together in an Epic. In some cases a *Story* can exist as a standalone *GitHub issue*.
  Grouping standalone *Stories* with labels is not something, what we encourage you to do.
* *Bug* *GitHub Issue* of type *Bug* is used to report any kind of problems. It can be
  a standalone *GitHub Issue* or can be a sub-issue of an *Epic* or a *Saga*.
  It is also ok to use labels to group multiple *Bugs* that are related to the same topic.

Main *SCORE* project defines templates for every type of *GitHub Issues*
to ensure, that every ticket has all necessary information.

For a better structuring of the *GitHub Issues*, we use a beta
`sub-issue feature <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/adding-sub-issues>`_,
that should be officially released in the beginning of 2025.
*Sub-issue feature* allows to create a "parent-child" relationship between *GitHub Issues*.
That allows better structuring of the project and helps to keep *GitHub Issues*, that
are related to the same topic, together.

.. image:: _assets/sub_issues.png
    :width: 600
    :alt: Sub issues overview
    :align: center


Traceability
^^^^^^^^^^^^
To achieve a better traceability it is highly recommended to link all *PRs* to the corresponding
*GitHub Issues*. If done properly, you will be able to see for every *GitHub Issue*
all relevant source code changes. Normally *PRs* reference *GitHub issues* of type *Story*
or of type *Bug*. How to link *PRs* to *GitHub Issues* is described in more details in this
`guide <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue>`_.

.. image:: _assets/traceability.png
    :width: 300
    :alt: Traceability overview
    :align: center

GitHub Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*GitHub Projects* is a very powerful tool that allows creation of various views on
the status of the project, helps to plan the work and to monitor the current progress.
In particular, *GitHub Project* allows to extend *GitHub Issues* with following information:

* objective
* dependencies on other activities or information
* responsible person
* resources
* mapping to work product
* start, end, duration, effort

Note: The information on start, end, duration, and effort may sometimes be complicated
to estimate in the execution in an open source environment. Nevertheless, tasks
should be planned as part of releases, which sets already an implicit
duration and end date.

Software module project leads shall also use *GitHub Project* for their planning. The overview of *GitHub Project* features can be found `here <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects>`_.

Multiple *GitHub projects* are defined in the main *SCORE* project:

* a separate project for every community
* a project for technical lead circle
* a (GitHub) *roadmap project* with the overview of all upcoming features & releases.

  As *GitHub Projects* are not restricted to one repository but
  can include information from multiple repositories of the same organization,
  *roadmap project* gives an overview of all *Sagas*, that are relevant for the roadmap,
  including those ones in the software modules. Prerequisite for this is that project
  leads of all software modules always assign their sagas to the *roadmap project*.
  All sagas in the *roadmap project* are extended with additional information
  as e.g. start date and due date, to keep the status of the project always transparent.
  Additionally, the main *SCORE* repository defines project wide milestones & releases,
  that are visible in the roadmap as well.

.. image:: _assets/roadmap_example.png
    :width: 600
    :alt: Roadmap example
    :align: center

Releases and milestones
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
GitHub allows to define various milestones & releases for every repository. The definition of the milestones and releases is proposed by the *Technical Leads* and is approved by *Project Leads*.

In the main *SCORE* project we use milestones to mark important stages of the project and map sagas or in some cases also other *GitHub Issues* to them.

*Releases* are used for structuring of the development activities. Exact scheme for the releases of the *SCORE* will be provided here later.

You can find "up to date" overview of the release plan and milestones in the following section `Score Releases <https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/score_releases/index.html>`_.

Planning process
----------------
Generally, every team is responsible for planning and managing of its backlog.
For small improvements or clarifications, you can create *GitHub Issue* with a exhaustive
description and map it to the topic using labels. For small improvements/bugs
in the software modules you should create *GitHub Issues* directly in the repository
of the submodule. The project leads and committers of the corresponding software module,
circle or community will check the issue and in case they will accept it, they will
take it over to one of their *GitHub Projects*. In case, the topic, that you raise in the issue has a big impact on the platform, you can be asked by the committers to raise a *Feature Request* and to do a POC in the `incubation repository <https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/features/integration/index.html#incubation-repositories>`_ .

Contribution to the project is described in more details in `Contribution Request Guideline <https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/process/guidelines/contribution_request/index.html>`_.
In general, everyone who wants to provide something new to the project, e.g. a new feature
or a tool, should provide an exhaustive description, requirements and in some cases
also initial draft of the architecture as part of the *Feature Request*.
*Feature Requests* are regularly reviewed in the *Technical lead circle*
and then get either accepted or declined.

After the *Feature Request* was accepted, then the *Pull Request* with the
*Feature Request* gets merged. The corresponding *GitHub Issue* gets a reference to the
newly defined saga which plans the implementation of the feature request and afterwards *GitHub Issue* for *Feature Request* gets closed. The saga is at the beginning in the state *"Draft"*. Please be aware, that "status" of the tickets is modelled in *GitHub Project* as *GitHub Issues* do not provide the possibility to define additional states.

The *Technical lead circle* is responsible for maintenance of the backlog with sagas,
their prioritization and creation of the roadmap. Together with software module
project leads and community leads in the "Committer circle" they go through the backlog, decide when and which saga should be implemented in which order and update the roadmap accordingly.

As soon as the saga was planned for implementation, its state is changed to *"Open"*.
As next step, a *GitHub Issue* of type *epic* is created as sub-issue of the saga
and gets assigned to one of the *Communities* for refinement. The state of the saga changes from "Open" to "In Specification".

.. image:: _assets/saga_status_workflow.svg
    :width: 900
    :alt: Planning workflow
    :align: center

The members of the *Responsible Community* define or refine feature, process or tool requirements. They may also create feature architecture and high level component requirements for every involved software component. Depending on the feature scope, one of the cross-functional team can be requested to make a POC in the `incubation repository <https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/features/integration/index.html#incubation-repositories>`_. Finally, *Responsible Community* does the break down of the corresponding *saga* to the tickets that can be assigned to the individual software modules or *communities*.
As most of the software modules will have their own separate repository,
then the detailed tracking of their work will also happen inside of that repository.
However, the corresponding saga of the SCORE repository will still have a sub-issue of type epic,
that will describe the work, that should be done inside of the software module for better planning.
In the epic description there should be a link to the software module repository ticket,
where the detailed information and break down to the stories can be found.
For those communities or modules, that are part of the main *SCORE* repository,
the break down to the stories should be done directly inside of the epic.

As soon as the work on saga starts, its status is changed to "In Progress"
and its sub-tickets get assigned to the project leads of the software modules
or leads of the *communities*. During the development of the saga,
we use "trunk based approach", it means, that we do not create any separate branches,
but develop the software directly in the trunk/main using feature flag, that is marked as "experimental" at the beginning.

The *Technical lead circle* regularly monitors the status of the sagas with the status
"In Progress", resolves conflicts and updates the roadmap if necessary.

As soon as the saga is implemented and fulfills to 100% our software development process requirements, the decision is taken in the *Technical lead circle* whether the feature should be
officially available and in case of the positive decision, the feature flag status
is changed from "experimental" to "official".
