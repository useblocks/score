 Naming Convention
*******************

In order to keep an overview which branch belongs to whom the branch
name also should be descriptive. The following rules shall apply:

#. The branch name shall start with your github username. This will make
   it easier for everybody to identify the owner of the branch.
#. Branch names must be lower case.
#. Concatenation is done by underscores _.

An example could look like this:

Mustermann, GitHub Name: maximuster

.. code::

   maximuster_my_awesome_branch_name
